        </ul>
    
    <p>I am a 23-year-old woman with a background in Optometry and a growing passion for software development.
    After earning my Bachelors degree from the University of Johannesburg and working as an optometrist,
    I decided to explore technology  a field I had always been curious about.</p>
    <p>In April,I joined the <strong>FNB App Academy</strong>, where I began learning the fundamentals of coding and software development.
    That experience opened my eyes to the possibilities of tech, and I have been learning and growing ever since.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am part of the <strong>Power Learn Project</strong>, where I am further developing my skills and knowledge in software development.</p>
